# Breaker
This is the first project of my class Proyecto de Desarrollo de Videojuegos that my partner Heriberto Gil and I created using Java language. This project is a reinterpretation of the classic game Breaker in which the objective is to break all de bricks at the top of the screen with a ball that is constantly bouncing and you have to ensure that the ball doesn't touch the bottom-edge of the screen.
